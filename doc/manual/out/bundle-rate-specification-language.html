  # This name can be shared between different bundle-rates.
  # It does not contain details about the service, but only an high level classification.

  service-cdr-description: [textual description]
  # a textual description, associated to the service-cdr,
  # describing the details of the service offered/billed from the bundle-rate,
  # in the call report, and invoices.
  # It will be generated only if the bundle-rate service-cdr cost is greather than 0.
  # It will be generated for each organization associated to the bundle-rate.
  # There will be a unique service-cdr, with the sum of all the cost of nested bundle-rates.

  schedule: [monthly|weekly]
  # after each scheduling period (time-frame), the bundle rate status is resetted,
  # and the bundle-rate service-cdrs are produced.

  apply-for-each: [list of price-category]
  # This bundle-rate is applied to organizations/extensions
  # with an explicit assignment to this specified price-categories.
  #
  # If an organization/extension inherits the price-category from its parent
  # organization, but it has no explicit assignment,
  # then it has no a distinct bundle-rate status:
  # * a service-cdr is generated only for its parents with explicit assignment;
  # * there is no separate limits allocated for the extension,
  #   but the limits of the parent organization are used instead;
  #
  # The date of price-category assignment is used for determining when the bundle-rate
  # can be applied.
  #
  # Service-cdr is generated also if there are no calls for him, inside the time-frame.

  limits-are-proportionals-to-activation-date: [true|false]
  # true if the bundle-rate limits on an organization/extension created not at the beginning of a time-frame,
  # but after X% days, must be scaled of X%.
  #
  # If true, then also the bundle-rate costs are proportional to the activation date.
  #
  # Only the activation (starting) date is considered, but not the date on which an organization/extension change
  # price-category, and exit from the bundle-rate. The consequences are that if an organization enters
  # at day 15 into a monthly bundle-rate A, and it exits from it at day 20 entering in monthly bundle-rate B,
  # then the organization pays both the bundle A at 50%, and the bundle B at 66% for the month with the change.
  #
  # In case there are repeated assignments to the same price-category, inside the same time-frame of the bundle-rate,
  # only the first assignment is taken in account.

  only-for-calls-with-a-cost: [true|false]
  # true for applying the bundle only to calls having a positive cost.
  # So free calls are not counted as inside the bundle.
  # This is an advantage for end customers, because they can use the bundle
  # only for calls with a cost.
