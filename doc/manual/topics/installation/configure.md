# Configure instances

Edit the file ``asterisell_instances.py``. In particular the host and domain where installing a first DEMO instance of Asterisell.

Settings can be improved later, so initially start with good-enough settings.

The remote host will be configured using the instructions inside ``fabric_data/lib.py`` file. 
If you use the host only for Asterisell instances, it should be all ok. 
Otherwise if you install more services on the same host, you can customize these instructions.
