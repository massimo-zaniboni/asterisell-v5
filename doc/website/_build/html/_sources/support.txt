For contributing to the development, the suggeste way is:

* Fork `Asterisell GitHub Repository`_
* For every modified source code file add yourself to the list of authors/contributors, using something like: ``Copyright (C) 20XX You Name <optionally-your-email@example.net>``. This is mandatory for GPL compliance, except in case of correction of typos.
* Send a pull request.

Current Status
--------------

Asterisell v1 is used in production from 2007.

Asterisell v5 is used in production from 2015, and it can be considered a stable and tested application.

Every new release can introduce unexpected but temporary problems. Read the `Asterisell News_` section for knowing which parts are changed.
